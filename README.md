#Student Version
The mission is to keep everything as simple as possible. This includes user interaction and interface so that eveyrone can use it,
and so it can take less time as possible for interaction.

#Teacher Version
Teacher Version has to make it easy to search for students at any time in case of emergency, keeps the history of where the student has been, and to get notifications when a student changes their location.
The teacher end still needs to be coded and it needs to have a Mac App Compatible with OS X 10.9 along with iOS.
